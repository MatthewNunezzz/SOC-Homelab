* **Nessus Plugin ID:** 42873 
* **Port / Protocol:** 3389 / tcp / msrdp
* **Description:** Domain controller supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer medium strength encryption (less than 112 bit key length). Medium strength encryption may pose risks such as susceptibility to sophisticated brute force attacks or compliance expiration. 
* **Evidence:** ![](nessus_screenshots/nessus_ss_04.png)
* **Remediation:** Reconfigure domain controller to avoid using medium ciphers if possible.

### WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation CVE-2013-3900 Mitigation (EnableCertPaddingCheck)

* **Severity:** High
* **Famliy:** Windows: Microsoft Bulletin
* **Nessus Plugin ID:** 166555 
* **Port / Protocol:** 445 / tcp / cifs
* **Description:** A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the WinVerifyTrust function handles signature verification for portable execution files. This vulnerability allows an attacker to append malicious code to the padding of a signed file.
* **Evidence:** ![](nessus_screenshots/nessus_ss_05.png)
* **Remediation:** To remediate the "padding check" must be manually enabled via the windows registry.

### Security Updates for Windows Defender

* **Severity:** High
* **Famliy:** Windows: Microsoft Bulletin
* **Total Vulnerability Count:** 17
* **Description:** The Malware Protection Engine of Microsoft Windows Defender installed is a few security updates behind exposing the system to a multitude of vulnerabilities including denial of service, privilege escalation, etc.
* **Evidence:** ![](nessus_screenshots/nessus_ss_06.png)
* **Remediation:** Updating Microsoft Defender to platform version 4.18.24010.12 or later to resolve this issue.

### Security Update for Forefront Endpoint Protection

* **Severity:** High
* **Famliy:** Windows
* **Total Vulnerability Count:** 3
* **Description:** The Malware Protection Engine of Forefront Endpoint Protection is equal or prior to 1.1.17700.4 exposing it to multiple vulnerabilities including remote code execution, denial of service, etc.
* **Evidence:** ![](nessus_screenshots/nessus_ss_07.png)
* **Remediation:** Enable automatic updates to update the malware engine for the relevant antimalware applications and verify that MMPE has been updated.

### Curl Use-After-Free < 7.87 (CVE-2022-43552)

* **Severity:** Medium
* **Famliy:** Windows
* **Nessus Plugin ID:** 171859 
* **Port / Protocol:** 445 / tcp / cifs
* **Description:** Version of Curl installed is 7.79.1.0 making it susceptible to the use-after-free vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, information leaks, and system crashes.
* **Evidence:** ![](nessus_screenshots/nessus_ss_08.png)
* **Remediation:** Updating Curl to version 7.87.0 or later.

## 5. Security Recommendations

1. **Disable Legacy Protocols:** If LLMNR or NetBIOS showed up in your scan, recommend disabling them.
2. **Patch Management:** List any missing KB (Knowledge Base) updates Nessus found.
3. **Hardening:** Suggest implementing a "Tiered Administrative Model" or disabling RDP if not strictly necessary.

## Conclusion & Post-Remediation Status

The initial assessment of the Domain Controller identified a significant attack surface, primarily due to [outdated patch levels/legacy configurations]. Following the identification of 65 Critical and 186 High vulnerabilities, a remediation phase was initiated.

Key Actions Taken:
- Applied Cumulative Security Updates (fixing X vulnerabilities).
- Hardened the Windows Registry against CVE-2013-3900.
- Disabled insecure legacy protocols (SMBv1).

Final Posture: A follow-up verification scan confirmed a [X]% reduction in Critical findings. While some "Informational" risks remain, the primary vectors for Remote Code Execution have been mitigated. The system is now considered [Stable/Hardened] for production use.
